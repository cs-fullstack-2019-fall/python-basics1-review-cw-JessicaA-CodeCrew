# Problem 1:
# Create a program that prints the user input until they enter 'q' to quit.

# askUser = input("Enter a number: ")
# while askUser != 'Q':
#     askUser = input("More Info: ")
# print(askUser)


# Problem 3:
# Create a program that takes user input in a while loop. If they enter 1, print 1. If they enter 2, print 2. If they enter 3 print 3. If they enter ‘q’ or 0 (your choice), quit. Else, print “ERROR”.
#
# askUser = input('Enter 1 or 2: ')
# while askUser == 1:
#     print("1")
#     if askUser == 2:
#         print("2")


# Problem 4:
# Create a program that takes the user input until they enter 'q'. You should store all of their input and separate the input with a comma. Once they enter 'q', print all of the comma separated words they entered.

ask1 = input("Enter Input: ")
while ask1 == input():
    print( ask1, ",",ask1, ",", ask1)
